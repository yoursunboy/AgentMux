# AgentMux Roadmap

## Implementation status

As of version 0.1.0:

| Phase | Status | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 — Foundation and documentation | **Done** | Workspace, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, docs, environment checks. |
| Phase 1 — Project model and server foundation | **Done** | Config, SQLite, HostAdapter, discovery, register/create API, server status, Phase 1 UI. |
| Phase 2 and later | Not started | No session runtime, no tmux, no terminal, no provider integration. |

What this means in practice: `GET /api/server` reports `terminalRuntimeImplemented: false`, the
provider reports `integrated: false`, and the UI renders no terminal. Nothing in the running product
claims to do more than the table above.

## Phase 0 — Foundation and documentation

Status: **done**.

Deliver:

- Go/React workspace skeleton;
- `CLAUDE.md`;
- `.claude/rules/`;
- architecture docs;
- environment checks.

No tmux implementation yet.

## Phase 1 — Project model and server foundation

Status: **done**. See `docs/API.md` for the endpoints this phase adds.

Goal:

Support the real folder organization model.

Deliver:

- configuration;
- SQLite;
- Projects Root configuration;
- Group/Collection-aware project model;
- bounded candidate discovery;
- explicit project registration;
- New Project in selected collection;
- Open/Register Project API;
- HostAdapter skeleton;
- basic server status.

Important:

Do not assume first-level directories are projects.

## Phase 2 — Persistent session runtime

Deliver:

- SessionBackend interface;
- TmuxBackend;
- create/list/start/stop/destroy;
- raw input;
- resize;
- output capture;
- multiple isolated sessions.

Use shell/test processes first.

## Phase 3 — Claude runtime

Deliver:

- launch Claude in registered project working directory;
- send input;
- receive real TUI output;
- disconnect leaves Claude alive;
- reconnect to existing session.

## Phase 4 — Web terminal

Deliver:

- xterm.js;
- WebSocket;
- ANSI/TUI fidelity;
- raw keyboard input;
- Prompt Bar;
- reconnect snapshot;
- touch terminal keys.

## Phase 5 — Multi-project grid

Deliver:

- ProjectPanel;
- 1×3 and 2×3 layouts;
- Project Manager;
- focus/full-screen;
- five concurrent project sessions;
- pagination foundation.

## Phase 6 — Multi-device control

Deliver:

- Viewer/Controller;
- atomic Take Control;
- 10-second lease;
- independent scroll;
- canonical PTY size;
- controller-only resize;
- software-keyboard resize protection.

## Phase 7 — Claude state awareness

Through Claude Hooks:

- READY;
- RUNNING;
- WAITING;
- COMPLETED;
- ERROR.

Terminal remains the real displayed interface.

## Phase 8 — CC Switch integration

Deliver:

- CCSwitchAdapter;
- current provider;
- provider list;
- global provider switch;
- no credential exposure;
- safe handling of active turns.

No per-project provider selection.

## Phase 9 — Runtime recovery and quality

Deliver:

- stronger reconnect;
- rolling terminal logs;
- Claude session ID tracking;
- safe resume;
- project slot persistence;
- Open VS Code;
- diagnostics.

## V1.0

Release criteria:

- Windows + WSL supported;
- Linux supported;
- collection-aware project management;
- stable multi-project terminal grid;
- safe multi-device control;
- global CC Switch provider management;
- state detection;
- robust reconnect/recovery.

## Post-V1

Only after Claude runtime is stable, add a generic ToolAdapter for:

- Codex;
- Gemini CLI;
- OpenCode;
- other terminal-based coding agents.
